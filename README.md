# Diabetes Classification Using Neural Networks

## Dataset Overview
The dataset, **diabetes.csv**, contains information from over 250,000 individuals sourced by the CDC. Each row corresponds to an individual's health and demographic details, with the following columns:

1) **Diabetes status**: `1` = diagnosed with diabetes, `0` = not diagnosed
2) **High blood pressure**: `1` = diagnosed with hypertension, `0` = not diagnosed
3) **High cholesterol**: `1` = diagnosed with high cholesterol, `0` = not diagnosed
4) **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Calculated as weight divided by height squared
5) **Smoker**: `1` = has smoked over 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, `0` = has not
6) **Stroke**: `1` = has previously suffered a stroke, `0` = has not
7) **Myocardial issues**: `1` = has previously had a heart attack, `0` = has not
... and so forth up to:
22) **Zodiac sign**: `1` = Aries, `12` = Pisces, etc.

## Primary Objectives and Methods
The analysis involves applying neural network models to understand and predict various health conditions such as BMI and diabetes status from the dataset.

### Implemented Solutions:
1. **Perceptron for Diabetes Classification**:

2. **Feedforward Neural Network**:

3. **Deep Neural Network**:
